                <h4>IPL 2022 final</h4>
                <br>
                <p>Reserving his best-ever IPL show with the ball for the final, Pandya unleashed four fine overs of fast bowling to leave the Royals gasping for breath. He scalped his opposite number Sanju Samson (14) with just his second ball, before following up with the big wicket of Jos Buttler (39, 35, 5x4) and then Shimron Hetmeyer (11) to rip the heart out of the Royals’ innings.</p>
                <p>Pandya made his One Day International (ODI) debut for India against New Zealand on 16 October 2016 at Dharamshala. He became the fourth Indian to be named player of the match on ODI debut after Sandeep Patil, Mohit Sharma and K. L. Rahul.[23] In his first ODI innings as a batsman, he scored 36 runs from 32 balls. In the group stages of ICC Champions Trophy, Pandya hit three consecutive sixes off Imad Wasim in the same over before rain stopped play. On 18 June 2017, in the final of the Champions Trophy at the Oval, he struck a 43-ball 76 in a losing cause, after coming in with India at 54/5 following a top order collapse</p>
                <p>Pandya was included in India's Test squad for their home series against England in late 2016,[30] but was eventually left out after he injured himself while training in the nets at the PCA Stadium.[31] He was named in the squad that toured Sri Lanka in July 2017 and played his first Test on 26 July in Galle.[32] In the 3rd and the final Test match against Sri Lanka at Pallekele, Pandya scored his maiden Test century, and set the record for becoming the first Indian batsman to score a Test century just before lunch. He also set the record for scoring the most runs in a single over of a Test innings for India, scoring 26 runs.[33][34][35] This century was his first century in international cricket.</p>
